sc.mailchimp.api Installation
==================================

To install sc.mailchimp.api into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install sc.mailchimp.api``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

or

* You run ``pip install sc.mailchimp.api``.Find out how to pip installs Python packages here:
http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``sc.mailchimp.api`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        sc.mailchimp.api

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout -vvv

* It's not necessary tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug.

* Find out how to using in README.txt file
